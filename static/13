History[]
Background[]
The , ratified by the colonies in 1781, contained the clause, "The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective states—fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States". Article 1, section 8, of the
(1789), transferred this power to Congress; "The Congress shall have power...To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures".
In January 1790,
, in his first
stated that, "Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to", and ordered
to prepare a , afterwards referred to as the Jefferson report. On October 25, 1791, Washington appealed a third time to Congress, "A uniformity of the weights and measures of the country is among the important objects submitted to you by the
and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the public council than conducive to the public convenience", but it was not until 1838, that a uniform set of standards was worked out.
In 1821,
had declared "Weights and measures may be ranked among the necessities of life to every individual of human society".
From 1830 until 1901, the role of overseeing weights and measures was carried out by the , which was part of the .
Bureau of Standards[]
In 1901, in response to a bill proposed by Congressman
(R, Ohio), the National Bureau of Standards was founded with the mandate to provide standard weights and measures, and to serve as the national physical laboratory for the United States. (Southard had previously sponsored a bill for metric conversion of the United States.)

appointed
as the first director. The budget for the first year of operation was $40,000. The Bureau took custody of the copies of the kilogram and meter bars that were the standards for US measures, and set up a program to provide
services for United States scientific and commercial users. A laboratory site was constructed in , and instruments were acquired from the national physical laboratories of Europe. In addition to weights and measures, the Bureau developed instruments for electrical units and for measurement of light. In 1905 a meeting was called that would be the first "National Conference on Weights and Measures".
Initially conceived as purely a metrology agency, the Bureau of Standards was directed by
to set up divisions to develop commercial standards for materials and products.page 133 Some of these standards were for products intended for government use, but product standards also affected private-sector consumption. Quality standards were developed for products including some types of clothing, automobile brake systems and headlamps, , and electrical safety. During , the Bureau worked on multiple problems related to war production, even operating its own facility to produce
when European supplies were cut off. Between the wars,
of the Bureau developed a
radio aircraft landing system. During
was carried out, including development of
forecast methods, the
and the standardized airframe used originally for , and shortly afterwards the autonomously radar-guided
anti-ship guided bomb and the
of torpedo-carrying missiles.

In 1948, financed by the United States Air Force, the Bureau began design and construction of , the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer. The computer went into operation in May 1950 using a combination of vacuum tubes and solid-state diode logic. About the same time the , was built at the Los Angeles office of the NBS by
and used for research there. A mobile version, , was built for the Signal Corps in 1954.
Due to a changing mission, the "National Bureau of Standards" became the "National Institute of Standards and Technology" in 1988.
Following September 11, 2001, NIST conducted the official investigation into the
buildings.
Constitution[]
NIST, known between 1901 and 1988 as the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), is a , also known as a National Metrological Institute (NMI), which is a non-regulatory agency of the . The institute's official mission is to:
Promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing , , and
in ways that enhance economic security and improve our .— NIST
NIST had an operating
for
2007 (October 1, 2006 – September 30, 2007) of about $843.3 million. NIST's 2009 budget was $992 million, and it also received $610 million as part of the . NIST employs about 2,900 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support and administrative personnel. About 1,800 NIST associates (guest researchers and engineers from American companies and foreign countries) complement the staff. In addition, NIST partners with 1,400 manufacturing specialists and staff at nearly 350 affiliated centers around the country. NIST publishes the Handbook 44 that provides the "Specifications, tolerances, and other technical requirements for weighing and measuring devices".
Metric system[]
The
made use of the metric system in commerce a legally protected activity through the passage of . On May 20, 1875, 17 out of 20 countries signed a document known as the Metric Convention or the Treaty of the Meter, which established the
under the control of an international committee elected by the .

Boulder Laboratories
NIST is headquartered in , and operates a facility in . NIST's activities are organized into laboratory programs and extramural programs. Effective October 1, 2010, NIST was realigned by reducing the number of NIST laboratory units from ten to six. NIST Laboratories include:
(CTL)
(EL)
(ITL)
(NCNR)
(MML)
(PML)
Extramural programs include:
(MEP), a nationwide network of centers to assist small and mid-sized manufacturers to create and retain jobs, improve efficiencies, and minimize waste through process improvements and to increase market penetration with innovation and growth strategies;
(TIP), a grant program where NIST and industry partners cost share the early-stage development of innovative but high-risk technologies;
Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which administers the , the nation's highest award for performance and business excellence.
NIST's Boulder laboratories are best known for , which houses an . NIST‑F1 serves as the source of the nation's official time. From its measurement of the natural resonance frequency of —which defines the —NIST broadcasts

and , located near Fort Collins and , respectively.
NIST also operates a
science user facility: the
(NCNR). The NCNR provides scientists access to a variety of
instruments, which they use in many research fields (materials science, fuel cells, biotechnology, etc.).
The
is a source of , in continuous operation since 1961. SURF III now serves as the US national standard for source-based radiometry throughout the generalized optical spectrum. All -borne, extreme-ultraviolet observation instruments have been calibrated at SURF since the 1970s, and SURF is used for measurement and characterization of systems for .
The Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) performs research in , both through internal research efforts and by running a user-accessible
facility. This "NanoFab" is equipped with tools for
patterning and imaging (e.g.,
and ).
Committees[]
NIST has seven standing committees:
(TGDC)
(ACEHR)
(NCST Advisory Committee)
(ISPAB)
(VCAT)
(MBNQA Board of Overseers)
(MEPNAB)

Measurements and standards[]
As part of its mission, NIST supplies industry, academia, government, and other users with over 1,300
(SRMs). These artifacts are certified as having specific characteristics or component content, used as calibration standards for measuring equipment and procedures, quality control benchmarks for industrial processes, and experimental control samples.
Handbook 44[]
NIST publishes the Handbook 44 each year after the annual meeting of the
(NCWM). Each edition is developed through cooperation of the Committee on Specifications and Tolerances of the NCWM and the Weights and Measures Division (WMD) of the NIST. The purpose of the book is a partial fulfillment of the statutory responsibility for "cooperation with the states in securing uniformity of weights and measures laws and methods of inspection".
NIST has been publishing various forms of what is now the Handbook 44 since 1918 and began publication under the current name in 1949. The 2010 edition conforms to the concept of the primary use of the SI (metric) measurements recommended by the
of 1988.
Homeland security[]
NIST is developing government-wide
standards for federal employees and contractors to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to government buildings and computer systems.
World Trade Center collapse investigation[]
In 2002, the
mandated NIST to conduct an investigation into the
buildings 1 and 2 and the 47-story 7 World Trade Center. The "World Trade Center Collapse Investigation", directed by lead investigator Shyam Sunder, covered three aspects, including a technical building and
investigation to study the factors contributing to the probable cause of the collapses of the WTC Towers (WTC 1 and 2) and WTC 7. NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes, standards, and practices, and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices, standards, and codes. NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners, contractors, architects, engineers, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters. The investigation portion of the response plan was completed with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center on November 20, 2008. The final report on the WTC Towers—including 30 recommendations for improving building and occupant safety—was released on October 26, 2005.
Election technology[]
NIST works in conjunction with the
of the
to develop the

Division from 1982 to 1984. In addition,
was awarded the 2011 Kyoto Prize for Materials Science, and the
has been awarded to NIST researchers Cahn (1998) and Wineland (2007). Other notable people who have worked at NBS or NIST include:
Directors[]
Main article:
Since 1989, the director of NIST has been a Presidential appointee and is confirmed by the , and since that year the average tenure of NIST directors has fallen from 11 years to 2 years in duration. Since the 2011 reorganization of NIST, the director also holds the title of Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology. Fifteen individuals have officially held the position (in addition to four acting directors who have served on a temporary basis).
Controversy regarding NIST standard SP 800-90[]
In September 2013, both
and
reported that NIST allowed the
(NSA) to insert a
called
into NIST standard SP 800-90 that had a
that the NSA can use to covertly predict the future outputs of this
thereby allowing the surreptitious decryption of data. Both papers report that the NSA worked covertly to get its own version of SP 800-90 approved for worldwide use in 2006. The whistle-blowing document states that "eventually, NSA became the sole editor". The reports confirm suspicions and technical grounds publicly raised by cryptographers in 2007 that the EC-DRBG could contain a
backdoor (perhaps placed in the standard by NSA).
NIST responded to the allegations, stating that "NIST works to publish the strongest cryptographic standards possible" and that it uses "a transparent, public process to rigorously vet our recommended standards". The agency stated that "there has been some confusion about the standards development process and the role of different organizations in it...The National Security Agency (NSA) participates in the NIST cryptography process because of its recognized expertise. NIST is also required by statute to consult with the NSA." Recognizing the concerns expressed, the agency reopened the public comment period for the SP800-90 publications, promising that "if vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible”. Due to public concern of this
attack, NIST rescinded the EC-DRBG algorithm from the NIST SP 800-90 standard.
